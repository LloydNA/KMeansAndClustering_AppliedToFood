    "<p>This article discusses an approach for defect (rotten) segmentation of fruits based on color features using the K-means clustering algorithm. The traditional manual identification of defected fruit is time-consuming, so this new method offers a more efficient solution. The defect segmentation process consists of two stages: clustering pixels based on their color and spatial features, and then merging the clustered blocks into a specific number of regions. This two-step procedure improves computational efficiency by avoiding feature extraction for every pixel. Although color is not commonly used for defect segmentation, it provides a high discriminative power for different regions of the fruit image.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The researchers conducted a case study using defected apples to evaluate the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the method in terms of precision and computational time. The authors used the K-means clustering technique in the L*a*b* color space, which contains a luminosity layer and two chromaticity layers. They classified colors using K-means clustering based on the Euclidean distance metric. The images were segmented into different clusters based on color, and the defected part of the fruit was identified by programmatically determining the index of each cluster containing the defected portion.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The results showed that using 3 or 4 clusters yielded good segmentation results for the defected apples. The number of clusters required for defect detection depended on the size of the defected area. Larger defected areas required fewer clusters, while smaller defected areas required more clusters. The proposed approach was able to accurately segment the defected part of the fruit images, including the presence of stems or calyxes.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In conclusion, the researchers presented an efficient defect segmentation approach for fruits based on color features and the K-means clustering algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the method in accurately identifying defected portions of the fruit images. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the quality and efficiency of defect segmentation in the agricultural industry.</p>"

    "\n",
    "<p>A study made by researchers in Iran wanted to develop a method to detect blast disease in rice plants using image processing techniques. Rice blast is a significant disease that affects rice yield. The researchers used color images obtained using a quadcopter equipped with a digital camera to detect disease spots on rice leaves. They applied image processing techniques, including the K-means algorithm and the Otsu method, to classify the images and identify disease spots.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 91.7% in determining the number of disease spots, and a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 95.65% in determining the quality of disease spots. The overall accuracy of the algorithm was 94%. The results suggested that the developed method has potential for timely diagnosis of rice blast. Rice is an important crop globally, providing food for a large portion of the population and contributing to food security. However, rice farming is threatened by various pests and diseases, including blast.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The use of machine vision and image processing techniques can be useful for rapid and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases. The researchers used the Lab color space for image processing, as it can describe all colors visible to the human eye. They converted RGB images to the Lab color space and performed clustering using the K-means algorithm to detect disease spots on rice leaves. The algorithm improved the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm by reducing computation time and considering significant attributes.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In conclusion, this study found that the developed algorithm had a higher overall accuracy compared to similar studies, demonstrating the potential of machine vision for disease detection in field conditions. The timely diagnosis of rice blast can help prevent the spread of the disease and minimize the use of chemical pesticides, leading to increased production and reduced environmental impact. This study highlights the importance of using image processing techniques in precision agriculture to improve disease management and enhance crop productivity.</p>"
